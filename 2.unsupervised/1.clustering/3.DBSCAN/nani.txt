DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) finds core samples in regions of 
high density and expands clusters from them. This algorithm is good for data which contains clusters 
of similar densit

The algorithm has two main parameters:
→ eps: The maximum distance between two samples is the key parameter in DBSCAN that determines wether one sample is considered to be in the neighborhood of the other. This distance is not a maximum limit for the distances between points within a cluster. It is important to choose an appropriate value for this parameter based on the specific dataset and the distance function being used.

→ min_samples: A point is considered to be a core point if it has a certain number of other samples (or a certain total weight) within its neighborhood, including itself. This is a criterion that is used in DBSCAN to determine which points are considered to be core points.

 it finds the areas of the dataset where the probability density function is the highest and clusters 
 the data points in those areas together.
 
 The algorithm assign the feature vectors to the clusters iteratively by shifting points towards the 
 highest density of feature points in region.
Mean-shift algorithm has so many fields. One of them are image processing and computer vision.

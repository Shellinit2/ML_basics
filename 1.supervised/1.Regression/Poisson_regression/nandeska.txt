Linear Regression is used in many industries such as Epidemiology, Finance 
and Economics. However, despite being used in all these areas it does have 
some flaws that makes itâ€™s predictions redundant in certain applications. Imagine you are a phone operator and want to predict how many calls you will receive in a day. Do you think Linear Regression would be a suitable model? The answer is NO for the following reasons:

The number of calls have to be greater or equal to 0, whereas in Linear Regression the output can be negative as well as positive.
The number of calls only take integer values but Linear Regression can output fractional values.

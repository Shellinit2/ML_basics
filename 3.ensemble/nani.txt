Ensemble learning is a general meta approach to machine learning that seeks better predictive performance by combining the predictions from multiple models.

The three main classes of ensemble learning methods are bagging, stacking, and boosting.


1.Bagging involves fitting many decision trees on different samples of the same dataset and averaging the predictions.
2.Stacking involves fitting many different models types on the same data and using another model to learn how to best combine the predictions.
3.Boosting involves adding ensemble members sequentially that correct the predictions made by prior models and outputs a weighted average of the predictions.
